Services

Rehearsal:

We have two rooms available to rehearse. Rooms both come with drum shells, guitar cabs, bass cabs, PA and microphones. 

£7.50 per hour 

£2 amp head rental per session



Recording: 

We can offer recording for you/your band.

We can record anything from basic programming instruments (drums, bass, synths, pads etc) to recording live sessions. 

We can also add in mixing and mastering for a additional fee. 

If you want us to mix and master pre recorded tracks, we can also do that for you! Along with re-amping guitars, vocal editing and editing drums. 

If you’re also a producer who is looking to hire a place to record, we can let out the studio for as long as you need it with full access to all our programmes, microphones, and any additional equipment. 

Feel free to contact us if you wish to ask us any questions.


“We also offer guitar lessons from £16 a hour and £9 for half hour”
